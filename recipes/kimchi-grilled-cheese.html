        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Golden brown, pan-fried Kimchi Grilled Cheese is on the menu! Melty cheese with a caramelized kimchi and bacon filling sit between two thick slices of sourdough bread. Yum, friends. YUM!</p>
        <p>Thick, crispy, golden brown pan-grilled slices of sourdough. The meltiest of melty cheeses, two kinds because we mean it. An exquisitely caramelized, smoky spicy-sweet, almost jammy kimchi and bacon filling. Lordy loo, an adventure awaits you too!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>sourdough</li>
                <li>American (so melty!) and gruyere cheeses</li>
                <li>butter (or mayo if you go that route with your grilled cheese-ing)</li>
                <li>kimchi</li>
                <li>bacon</li>
                <li>brown sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the bacon in a large pan over medium high heat until crisped and fat is rendered. Add the kimchi to the pan with the brown sugar. Pan fry for a few minutes, leaving it undisturbed for a few minutes at a time so it dries out and gets a little bit caramelized. Season with black pepper. Transfer to a bowl and wipe the pan clean.</li>
                <li>Layer your sandwiches: a slice of sourdough, two slices gruyere cheese, kimchi mixture, two slices American cheese, and a second slice of sourdough. Spread butter or mayo over the top and bottom of the sandwich.</li>
                <li>Heat the same skillet to medium heat; add the sandwich and cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown. Cut and serve. Magic.</li>
